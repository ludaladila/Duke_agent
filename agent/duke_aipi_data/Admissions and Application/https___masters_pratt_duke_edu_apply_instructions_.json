What was the most creative solution to a problem that you’ve ever designed/built, either physical or virtual?  Please include details.\nThe emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in recent years could cause significant changes to traditional banking systems and financial markets. These platforms operate on a blockchain, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. As a prospective Fintech graduate student, you are presented with the following hypothetical scenario\nIn a country with a strong and stable banking system, a new DeFi platform emerges and quickly gains popularity among the younger population. The platform offers high-interest savings accounts, instant peer-to-peer loans, and has its native token that starts to be used as a form of payment in various local businesses. The country’s central bank has not yet formulated a definitive stance on DeFi platforms.\nDiscuss the potential risks and benefits this DeFi platform brings to the country’s financial ecosystem, considering both macroeconomic and microeconomic perspectives. What should be the approach of the central bank to this newcomer platform?\nWhat would it look like if you were to design a bridge between this new DeFi platform and traditional financial institutions? The bridge should prioritize seamless integration and mutual growth for both sectors.\nGame Design, Development & Innovation\nYour unique perspectives, experiences and passions will impact the Masters of Engineering in Game Design, Development & Innovation program.

The process is described below.\nUpon accepting the offer of admission, a student will receive an email from our office with a User Name and password in order to complete the online Request for Temporary Visa Form – Part II.\nThe student completes the online form, prints it off, signs it, and returns it to our office, along with the appropriate supporting documents.\nStudents must show liquid funds in the total amount listed in the PDF document available on our\nTuition page\n.\nFinancial documents must be less than four months old.\nOnly after we receive everything from the student will our office complete Part I of the Request for Temporary Visa Form. At that time, the student’s entire packet will be sent to Duke Visa Services for processing.\nVisa documents (I-20 or DS-2019) are usually issued within 2 calendar weeks from the date that Duke Visa Services received the completed packet.\nRegister for your visa appointment only after you receive your visa documents.\nThose on non-Duke visas complete a modified process during the enrollment period.\nDuke University Policy on Documentation of Non-Citizen Students\nAll non-citizen students ((undergraduate, graduate and professional) must present evidence of immigration status to the Duke Visa Services Office before the first day of classes and whenever, thereafter, their status changes. Failure to comply will result in the inability to enroll for classes. Students who are outside the U.S. and who are therefore unable to comply (e.g. visa stamp delays) will be handled on a case by case basis.\nUndergraduate students who are not in lawful status, but who accurately report their status, will be allowed to enroll. Such students will be advised of the risks to them of being out of status and the importance of dealing with that situation through their own means and with private immigration counsel. Students who are not in lawful status are not eligible for Federal financial aid, but they may apply for Duke-based assistance.\nIndividual cases deemed worthy of a temporary exception to this Policy due to unusual circumstances may be presented to a hearing committee, by Duke Visa Services or the appropriate departmental representative, for consideration and recommendation to the Provost. The committee shall be composed of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, the Director of Visa Services and the appropriate representative from the student’s school or program.\nContact Admissions\nEmail Us\nJoin Our Mailing List",
