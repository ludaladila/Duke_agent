Send questions to\npratt_masters@duke.edu\nImportant Notes\nIf you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at\npratt_masters@duke.edu\nIf your transcripts cannot be sent due to a valid extenuating circumstance, contact\npratt_masters@duke.edu\nThere is no need to provide separate transcripts from study-abroad institutions, as long as the study-abroad credits appear on your official transcript from your home educational institution\nAnswers to Transcript Concerns\nYour Degree Has Been Conferred\nIf you have already completed a degree, please request that the school send Duke a final transcript showing all work completed, date of degree, and date degree conferred.\nHowever\n, if your transcript does not include the date and degree conferred, you must also submit a copy of your diploma, graduation certificate, or degree verification document.\nYour Final Transcript is Not Yet Available\nIf you completed your degree very recently or are still enrolled in a degree program, your final official transcript may not be available until very close to your enrollment date (late December/ early January or late summer). Duke will matriculate you without the final transcript.\nHowever\n, you must submit your final official transcript during new-student orientation, or your student status may be in jeopardy. Once the final transcript becomes available, request that it be sent to Duke immediately.\nYou Only Have One Final Official Transcript\nWe are aware that some international schools issue only one official transcript. If this is the case for the school or schools you attended, DO NOT send these documents to us. Unfortunately, Duke cannot return materials submitted in support of an application.\nInstead\n, send us exact copies that have been stamped as “Certified True Copies” by the appropriate institutional official of each institution that you attended. Copies that are not certified are not acceptable.\nYour Transcript is in a Language Other Than English\nIf your final official transcripts are not in English, please provide BOTH the original official transcript AND an English translation. If your institution does not issue documents in English, you must have the transcripts translated by a professional translation service. Self‐translations and notarized translations will not be accepted.\nYou Do Not Submit Your Official Transcripts\nThe submission of the final official transcript is essential for enrollment at Duke. If you do not verify your degree and submit your transcript before orientation, your enrollment could be in jeopardy. Therefore, you must send the required transcripts to Duke as soon as possible.\nStart Your Housing Search\nOff-Campus Housing in Durham\nOn behalf of the Office of Student Affairs, welcome to Duke and Durham, North Carolina!\nDurham is a vibrant community with a lot to enjoy.

Any unused form must be returned to the Duke Professional Master’s Program Admissions office.\nArriving on Campus\nYou must have visa documents, a passport, and a visa stamp to enter the United States. While it may be cheaper to book your travel far in advance, you are taking a big risk. If you do not have a visa stamp, you cannot travel, and you may lose money canceling and rebooking. We strongly recommend that you wait until you have the visa stamp in your passport before you book your travel.\nYou are able to enter the United States 30 days before the start of classes. Your I-20 will note the date you can enter the United States. If your visa is sponsored by Duke, you will register with Duke Visa Services during orientation.
