Discover when you should present your request.\nFor many organizations, the ideal time is before annual budgets are set.\nTalk to Others\nSpeak to colleagues who earned degrees while working. Ask them how their degrees advanced their careers. Ask managers in your company for advice on developing and presenting your request.\nAsk us to connect you with a recent Duke master’s graduate\nWrite a Formal Proposal\nPrepare a written request. Detail your motivations. Include a personal profile highlighting your accomplishments.\nPrepare to Negotiate\nThink through concessions you are willing to make. Include them in your proposal and be ready to discuss them in detail. Common points of negotiation include:\nForegoing raises or bonuses while in graduate school\nCommitting to staying with your company for a specified number of years.
