For Master of Engineering, Master of Engineering Management and Graduate Certificates:

Applicants must upload one (1) copy of a scannedunofficialtranscript from each institution attended. Admitted applicants sendofficialtranscripts at the time of admission.

Once you have uploaded your file, click“View Document”to ensure that what you’ve uploaded is legible throughout.

If you cannot upload a legible unofficial transcript, you will be asked to have an official transcript mailed to Duke. Contact us for help. This is a variation of our standard process and will delay review of your application.

Applicants from China and India may find theseTranscript Guidelineshelpful.

If requested, you must upload an image of the official scale your institution uses for grading.

The Grade Scale tells us what your grades mean. (You may also know this tool as the grading system, score system or percentage system.)

The scale should show differentiation between passing grades and indicate what is a failing grade. It should also explain other marks on your transcript, such as Withdrawal, Audit or Incomplete. It need not convert to a 4.0 scale.

Your image might be the reverse side of your transcript, a screenshot of your registrar’s guidelines or an excerpt from your transcript.

Reverse of Transcript Example from a US Institution

Reverse of Transcript Example from an Indian Institution

Excerpt from an Indian Institution

Screenshot Example from a Chinese Institution

Excerpt from Chinese Institution, in Both Chinese and English

Questions vary by degree program. Find your program and its short-answer essay questions below:

Please select one of these principles and explain how you hope to contribute and grow regarding that principle at Duke.

We require a resume highlighting experience, activities and leadership, whether in the classroom, in a volunteer setting, club or organization, or on the job. Work experience is not required for the campus program, but current undergraduates can focus on any internship experience.

If you have a preferred format, please use it. If you don’t, you might find it helpful to view sample resumes below from Duke students. Notice the kinds of information highlighted.

Generally, students with little experience should be able to get their resume down to a maximum of two pages.

Degree applicants are required to provide three (3) letters of recommendation.

Applicants for Graduate Certificate programs and non-degree applicants must provide two (2).

Recommendations are submitted electronically via the online application.

When you enter email addresses for your recommenders, they will receive a link to submit their letter of recommendation.

Letters can be academic or professional. If you’re still a student, at least one should be academic. If you’re a working professional, it’s fine for all to be professional.

When choosing academic recommendation providers, do not simply choose instructors who gave you the highest grades. Instead, consider selecting those who can give insight into your preparedness for a Duke Engineering master’s program.

Consider providing an overview of the program, a copy of your resume and an understanding of your goals to your recommenders before you complete your application.

You may submit GRE scores if you feel the scores enhance your application.

Please know that if you send us scores:

When sending scores to Duke, please indicate:

Personal copies are not acceptable, nor are “attested” or notarized copies.

It may take several weeks for ETS  to send us your scores. Plan to take the test or order prior scores at least one month prior to the deadline you seek.

For further information on the GRE, please visitgre.org

We receive GRE scores electronically from the ETS. Because we match scores by applicant name, it is important your name on the application and your name on your test scores be the same.

If not,you must contact us.

Please contact us if you are a candidate for a dual-degree program at Duke.

International applicants must submit official test scores unless eligible for a waiver.

All international students may be required to take English placement exams before the start of classes, pending their language score submission provided in their application for admission to the Pratt School of Engineering.

Submitting Duolingo English Test scores will allow students to waive additional placement exams. Depending on placement results, students are either exempt from or placed into an English course. Students with English course requirements must make satisfactory progress toward completing these requirements while in the program.

It can take several weeks for scores to arrive, so plan to take the test or order prior scores at least one month before the deadline you seek.

The Duolingo English Test is the preferred language testing option.

For more information on the Duolingo English Test, visitenglishtest.duolingo.com/applicants.

Plus, Duolingo seamlessly integrates with your application to the Pratt School of Engineering. It provides a further dimension to your candidacy by allowing for video interviews and writing samples to be captured and viewed by the admissions committee. As such, if you do attend Pratt School of Engineering, you will not have to be additionally assessed for language classes when you submit a Duolingo English Test as part of your application.

If you opt to submit scores from other standardized assessments, you may be required to complete additional language testing upon acceptance into our programs.

Report official scores and subscores:

Report official scores toInstitution Code 5156(Duke University). There is no department code.

Report official scores to “Duke University Pratt School of Engineering.”

We receive TOEFL scores electronically from the Educational Testing Service and IELTS results via mail from Cambridge ESOL, British Council, and IDP: IELTS Australia. Because we match scores by an applicant’s name, the name on the application and your test scores must be the same. If it is not,you must contact us.

We offer waivers of the English language testing requirement to:

Waivers based on citizenship are automatic.

If you believe you qualify for a waiver based on theeducationorworkcriteria, indicate this and then answer the questions in the waiver section of your online application that require you tostate where you completed the study or work requirement.

Due to the volume of applications we receive, we will not examine, confirm the status of, or grant any waiver requests prior to extending an offer of admission.  If your request is not granted, we will notify you as soon as possible to give you time to take the test.  Therefore, it is in your best interest to apply in the earliest round for each admission cycle.

All international students may be required to take oral and written English placement exams administered at Duke prior to the start of classes.

These exams are independent of the score submission requirement.

Depending on placement results, students are either exempt from, or placed into, English course(s). Students with English course requirements must make satisfactory progress toward completing these requirements while in the program.

An application fee of US $75 is required. You’ll pay it by credit card through the online application.

Application fee waivers are available, and many are automatic. If a request is required, it must be submitted before an application is submitted. Fees paid before a waiver is requested and confirmed cannot be refunded.

Your application includes a required video introduction. We use it to get to know you better.

You’ll answer one question. A prompt will be shown, and you will have at least 60 seconds of preparation time. Use the question labeled “Pratt.”

You do not have to use all of the allotted time.

You may start over once, but the question will change. If you have multiple applications in our system, you may see multiple questions.

Unlike many schools, Duke does not require financial support documents as part of the application; instead, students submit this information after they have been admitted and are enrolled in the program.

Duke does not automatically issue I-20s to students upon admission.  Instead, students work with the department to submit information and supporting documents toDuke’s Visa Services Office. The process is described below.

Those on non-Duke visas complete a modified process during the enrollment period.

International Applicants
Unlike many schools, Duke does not require financial support documents as part of the application; instead, students submit this information after they have been admitted and are enrolled in the program.
Duke does not automatically issue I-20s to students upon admission.  Instead, students work with the department to submit information and supporting documents to
Duke’s Visa Services Office
. The process is described below.
Upon accepting the offer of admission, a student will receive an email from our office with a User Name and password in order to complete the online Request for Temporary Visa Form – Part II.
The student completes the online form, prints it off, signs it, and returns it to our office, along with the appropriate supporting documents.
Students must show liquid funds in the total amount listed in the PDF document available on our
Tuition page
.
Financial documents must be less than four months old.
Only after we receive everything from the student will our office complete Part I of the Request for Temporary Visa Form. At that time, the student’s entire packet will be sent to Duke Visa Services for processing.
Visa documents (I-20 or DS-2019) are usually issued within 2 calendar weeks from the date that Duke Visa Services received the completed packet.
Register for your visa appointment only after you receive your visa documents.
Those on non-Duke visas complete a modified process during the enrollment period.
Duke University Policy on Documentation of Non-Citizen Students
All non-citizen students ((undergraduate, graduate and professional) must present evidence of immigration status to the Duke Visa Services Office before the first day of classes and whenever, thereafter, their status changes. Failure to comply will result in the inability to enroll for classes. Students who are outside the U.S. and who are therefore unable to comply (e.g. visa stamp delays) will be handled on a case by case basis.
Undergraduate students who are not in lawful status, but who accurately report their status, will be allowed to enroll.

On behalf of the Office of Student Affairs, welcome to Duke and Durham, North Carolina!

Durham is a vibrant community with a lot to enjoy. Below, we’ve listed below some tips, links, and suggestions to help you start your search.

If you have a car, your off-campus housing search can include places in the broader Durham area.

If you won’t have a car, consider living close to campus and understand youroptions for getting around:

We are looking forward to having you join our community!

In preparation for your time at Duke, as an international student who will need a student visa (F-1 sponsored by Duke, J-1 sponsored by Fulbright, or other visa status), you will need to follow the steps below to enroll:

Upon receipt of your Signature Page and supporting documents, the Admissions Team will verify your documents and complete Part I of the Duke Visa Services Request for Temporary Visa Form.

The Admissions Team and the Visa Services office reserve four weeks total from the date of receipt of ALL required documentation to issue visa documents. The Visa Services office will send visa documents to you via FedEx (after the visa documents have been issued). Only one form will be issued per student. Any unused form must be returned to the Duke Professional Master’s Program Admissions office.

You must have visa documents, a passport, and a visa stamp to enter the United States. While it may be cheaper to book your travel far in advance, you are taking a big risk. If you do not have a visa stamp, you cannot travel, and you may lose money canceling and rebooking. We strongly recommend that you wait until you have the visa stamp in your passport before you book your travel.

You are able to enter the United States 30 days before the start of classes. Your I-20 will note the date you can enter the United States. If your visa is sponsored by Duke, you will register with Duke Visa Services during orientation. Non-Duke sponsored new students register directly at Visa Services. More information will be included in communication prior to orientation.

Review Visa Information
For International Students
Applying for a Visa
We are looking forward to having you join our community!
In preparation for your time at Duke, as an international student who will need a student visa (F-1 sponsored by Duke, J-1 sponsored by Fulbright, or other visa status), you will need to follow the steps below to enroll:
Accept the offer of admission via the
the application system
.
Review the
estimated student expenses
for the academic year.
The Admissions Office will send you an email with visa instructions and a link to the Duke Visa Services Request for Temporary Visa Form, Part II. You will be required to complete this form in its entirety and to follow the step by step process outlined in the email.
In the Visa portal, upload signature page and all required documents for our Admissions team’s review.
Processing Your Visa Documents
Upon receipt of your Signature Page and supporting documents, the Admissions Team will verify your documents and complete Part I of the Duke Visa Services Request for Temporary Visa Form.
The Admissions Team and the Visa Services office reserve four weeks total from the date of receipt of ALL required documentation to issue visa documents. The Visa Services office will send visa documents to you via FedEx (after the visa documents have been issued). Only one form will be issued per student. Any unused form must be returned to the Duke Professional Master’s Program Admissions office.
Arriving on Campus
You must have visa documents, a passport, and a visa stamp to enter the United States. While it may be cheaper to book your travel far in advance, you are taking a big risk. If you do not have a visa stamp, you cannot travel, and you may lose money canceling and rebooking. We strongly recommend that you wait until you have the visa stamp in your passport before you book your travel.
You are able to enter the United States 30 days before the start of classes. Your I-20 will note the date you can enter the United States. If your visa is sponsored by Duke, you will register with Duke Visa Services during orientation. Non-Duke sponsored new students register directly at Visa Services. More information will be included in communication prior to orientation.

Employer Support
You’ll gain the most from your Duke education if your organization supports you. Here’s some advice:
Start Now
Obtaining approval will probably take longer than you expect, so allow plenty of time.
Evaluate Yourself
Demonstrate motivation. Plan a career path within your organization. Identify the skills and knowledge you need to assume more responsibility. As you plan, anticipate concerns from your employer, such as:
How will you manage time away from the office?
How will costs be paid?
How will you continue to excel on the job?
How, and why, does a Duke master’s degree offer greater value than other programs?
The answers are here
Do Your Homework
Research your organization’s continuing education policy and its approval process. Discover when you should present your request.
For many organizations, the ideal time is before annual budgets are set.
Talk to Others
Speak to colleagues who earned degrees while working. Ask them how their degrees advanced their careers. Ask managers in your company for advice on developing and presenting your request.
Ask us to connect you with a recent Duke master’s graduate
Write a Formal Proposal
Prepare a written request. Detail your motivations. Include a personal profile highlighting your accomplishments.
Prepare to Negotiate
Think through concessions you are willing to make. Include them in your proposal and be ready to discuss them in detail. Common points of negotiation include:
Foregoing raises or bonuses while in graduate school
Committing to staying with your company for a specified number of years. (A two-year commitment is common)

Employer Support
You’ll gain the most from your Duke education if your organization supports you. Here’s some advice:
Start Now
Obtaining approval will probably take longer than you expect, so allow plenty of time.
Evaluate Yourself
Demonstrate motivation. Plan a career path within your organization. Identify the skills and knowledge you need to assume more responsibility. As you plan, anticipate concerns from your employer, such as:
How will you manage time away from the office?
How will costs be paid?
How will you continue to excel on the job?
How, and why, does a Duke master’s degree offer greater value than other programs?
The answers are here
Do Your Homework
Research your organization’s continuing education policy and its approval process. Discover when you should present your request.
For many organizations, the ideal time is before annual budgets are set.
Talk to Others
Speak to colleagues who earned degrees while working. Ask them how their degrees advanced their careers. Ask managers in your company for advice on developing and presenting your request.
Ask us to connect you with a recent Duke master’s graduate
Write a Formal Proposal
Prepare a written request. Detail your motivations. Include a personal profile highlighting your accomplishments.
Prepare to Negotiate
Think through concessions you are willing to make. Include them in your proposal and be ready to discuss them in detail. Common points of negotiation include:
Foregoing raises or bonuses while in graduate school
Committing to staying with your company for a specified number of years. (A two-year commitment is common)
