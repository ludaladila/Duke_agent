    "N o matter when you apply, you’ll remain an undergraduate for four years before becoming a MEng/MEM student in the fifth year. That means that you should select your application term based on when you’ll actually join the program after graduation, not when you’d like to take and MEng/EGRMGMT or departmental graduate courses you plan to transfer. For that reason, the application will choose summer term 1 for the year of your BSE graduation, but your application will be considered and a decision will be posted in the admission timeline you seek.",
    "Example:If you’d like a decision before you take the classes, apply using the deadlines the term in which you’ll take them. For example, if you want to take the classes in Spring, you’d apply using Spring admission deadlines to hear back by December 1 of your senior year.",

Students must apply for the MEng Program independently from the PhD and must be enrolled in the MEng Program (i.e., dual enrolled in the MEng and PhD) before taking the MEng core courses. Students should register for these MEng core courses separately from their PhD courses under their MEng “bookbag” and will be billed for these courses separately from their PhD. Other MEng courses to be utilized to fulfill the MEng requirements may be taken at anytime while a PhD student, before or after enrolling in the MEng Program.",

The thesis would consist of a detailed Business Plan, complete with extended Introduction (similar to the extended Introduction currently required of Third Year students who choose the manuscript or grant alternative theses) stating more thoroughly the human health need being addressed. The scope, subject, and outcomes of the thesis will be determined by the Engineering program of specialization in collaboration with the School of Medicine. A thesis alternative can be submitted in the form of a SBIR/STTR grant application since the grant thesis alternative is already an approved option offered to all Third Year medical students. At the discretion of and selected by the Third Year Committee, the thesis may be reviewed by faculty or other experts well versed in the specific technology field who are not on the Committee.

    "Because this is a concurrent degree and School of Medicine courses are being used to fulfill MEng degree requirements, the MEng degree will be granted simultaneous to the granting of the MD degree, typically at the end of the 5th year. If a MD/MEng student leaves the MD program before completing both degrees, a case-by-case analysis may be performed to determine if the MEng degree may be granted independently or if additional coursework is required to independently fulfill the MEng degree requirements.

To achieve this, each MD/MEng student may work under the auspices of Faculty in the School of Medicine, MedBlue Program, the Pratt School of Engineering, or other similar program to be reviewed and approved by representatives from the MEng and SOM faculty. Specifically, each MD/MEng candidate will:work under the guidance of one or two attending physicians and engineers during their 4th year (“second third year”) to identify and complete at least one comprehensive Confidential Need Specification with the sponsorship of one of the clinical faculty;develop new technologies or engineering approaches (including optimization/system analysis or feasibility analysis, etc.) for improving human health based on the Need Specification;present their proposed technology or engineering approach to a select group of prospective investors and/or end users (clinicians);complete an Invention Disclosure Form approved by faculty advisor for the project and the faculty who teach the internship course, MEng 551(optional) submit the IDF, which requires review and signature of appropriate SOM Department Chair; review and signature by appropriate Engineering Department Chair.(optional) provide required information and support to OLV to assist in their review and action.Example CurriculumThe MD/MEng is most closely aligned with the Biomedical Engineering major and is ideal for medical students with an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. The example below shows the Pratt course work requirements for a major in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Healthcare Innovation and Entrepreneurship.The MEng in Biomedical Engineering with Emphasis on Health Care Innovation and EntrepreneurshipRequirementMD-MEng Fulfillment of RequirementCore Industry Preparation Courses (6 credits)MEng 540 Management of High Tech Industries (3 credits)MEng 570 Business Fundamentals for Engineers (3 credits)Life Science (3 credits)Satisfactory completion of SoM 1 Basis SciencesAdvanced mathematics (3 credits)SeeBME websitefor approve math coursesBME courses (9 credits)BME 590.01 – Biomedical Device Innovation (3 credits)Select from BME offerings described inBME curricular notes(6 credits)Engineering Elective (3 credits)BME 490 Special Topics in BME Design (3 credits)Other technical electives (6 credits)Completion of SoM 1 Basic Sciences fulfills this requirementInternship, Project or Equivalent (zero credits)MENG 550 Internship or Applied Research ProjectMENG 551 Internship/Project AssessmentNote: students perform internship as described in this proposalBME seminar (zero credits)EGRMGMT 501 Engineering Management SeminarApplication Requirements and ProcessThe applicant must be in good standing with the School of Medicine. Applications should be submitted using an application to the Master of Engineering program. MD/MEng students should indicate on their application that they will be pursuing MEng as a concurrent degree.Students interested in this program should apply no later than March 15 in the second year of the MD program.See the links below for more information.Application deadlinesApplication Requirements(Note that applicants may use MCAT scores in lieu of GRE scores for the MD-MEng dual degree only.)Apply onlineReview ProcessThe student must inform the Third Year Study Program Director in the School of Medicine, the Director of Masters Studies in the appropriate MEng major, and the Pratt Professional Masters Admissions Office so that the application and dual degree plan can be reviewed and approved separately from the Pratt School general admissions review.TuitionStudents will payMaster of Engineering tuitionfor one year (two semesters) after the MS2 year and School of Medicine tuition for four years (SoM 1, SoM 2, SoM 3 [year 4], and SoM 4[year 5]). The typical MEng degree is 3 semesters and so obtaining a concurrent degree saves students the equivalent of one semester of tuition compared to obtaining both degrees separately.Granting of DegreeBecause this is a concurrent degree and School of Medicine courses are being used to fulfill MEng degree requirements, the MEng degree will be granted simultaneous to the granting of the MD degree, typically at the end of the 5th year. If a MD/MEng student leaves the MD program before completing both degrees, a case-by-case analysis may be performed to determine if the MEng degree may be granted independently or if additional coursework is required to independently fulfill the MEng degree requirements. Since no accommodation has been made to the MD requirements, students withdrawing from the MEng degree will not impact MD degree requirements.",

Alumni who are admitted may sometimes use work experience in lieu of the internship.\nAlumni without extraneous graduate courses year may require more than one additional year to complete the MEng degree –\ncontact us for more information\n.\nContact the admissions office\nfor more information.\nPhD + Master of Engineering\nStudents who received their PhD degree from Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering may also want to pursue a MEng degree to obtain the breadth found in the MEng core courses.\nTo facilitate this, PhD students may utilize their PhD courses to fulfill the technical course requirements of the MEng degree (i.e., the eight noncore course requirements) if those courses meet the curricular requirements of the MEng major of interest. Thus, PhD students may obtain the MEng degree by adding the two MEng core courses to their coursework and fulfilling the internship requirements.\nNote that generally the student’s PhD research will not be acceptable as the internship experience for the concurrent MEng degree. Students must apply for the MEng Program independently from the PhD and must be enrolled in the MEng Program (i.e., dual enrolled in the MEng and PhD) before taking the MEng core courses. Students should register for these MEng core courses separately from their PhD courses under their MEng “bookbag” and will be billed for these courses separately from their PhD. Other MEng courses to be utilized to fulfill the MEng requirements may be taken at anytime while a PhD student, before or after enrolling in the MEng Program.\nNote that being accepted as a PhD student does not guarantee acceptance as an MEng student. Note that students will generally receive their MEng degree at the same time or after receiving their PhD. If a student does not obtain a PhD, only four of the technical courses taken as a PhD student may be applied to the MEng degree. The other four technical MEng course requirements and the MEng core courses must be taken after enrollment in the MEng Program.\nAll PhD students should discuss their plans with their faculty advisor for their research program and with the DMS for their major of interest. When applying for the MEng degree, he/she should indicate they are already a PhD student and plan to do the MEng concurrently with their PhD.\nMD + Master of Engineering\nMD candidates in Duke’s School of Medicine have the option of adding the Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in a 5-year program. Students spend four years (Years 1, 2, 4 and 5) in medical school to fulfill the MD curriculum requirements, and one year (Year 3) to take the required MEng courses. In the fourth year, students work on development of new technologies or engineering approaches (including optimization/system analysis or feasibility analysis, etc.) for improving human health and write a thesis, for which they will receive School of Medicine credit in fulfillment of their Third Year thesis requirement.\nSchool of Medicine Requirements\nThe MD curriculum requirements for typical Years 1, 2, and 4 (Year 5 for dual students) remain unchanged by this program.\nSchool of Medicine Third Year thesis credit will be based on submission of a document whose rigor is consistent with current Third Year theses. As with all current Third Year theses, the thesis proposals will require Third Year School of Medicine approval. The thesis would consist of a detailed Business Plan, complete with extended Introduction (similar to the extended Introduction currently required of Third Year students who choose the manuscript or grant alternative theses) stating more thoroughly the human health need being addressed. The scope, subject, and outcomes of the thesis will be determined by the Engineering program of specialization in collaboration with the School of Medicine. A thesis alternative can be submitted in the form of a SBIR/STTR grant application since the grant thesis alternative is already an approved option offered to all Third Year medical students. At the discretion of and selected by the Third Year Committee, the thesis may be reviewed by faculty or other experts well versed in the specific technology field who are not on the Committee. These external reviews would be used by members of the Third Year Committee to grade the theses in order to ensure that the grading standards, rigor and criteria are consistent with current theses. The thesis may also be used to fulfill requirements for the MEng 550/551 courses.\nPratt School of Engineering Requirements\nMaster of Engineering students in all majors must complete 30 credits comprised of key program elements as follows:\nCore industry preparatory courses (6 credits)\nDepartmental or interdisciplinary core courses (15 – 18 credits, varies by major)\nTechnical electives in a concentrated area (6 – 9 credits, varies by major)\nInternship, Project, or Equivalent\nAdditionally, some majors have a seminar participation requirement.\nThe MD/MEng student will fulfill all of the requirements of the MEng degree. To accomplish this, the following accommodation has been made for those seeking a dual degree:\n6-9 credits (depends on MEng major) required for the MEng degree may be fulfilled based on satisfactory completion of the School of Medicine 1 Basic Sciences curriculum. See table below:\nMajor\nMD Credits Applied to\nMaster of Engineering Degree\nDescription\nBiomedical Engineering\n9\n3 Credits – Life Science Requirement\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nCivil Engineering\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nElectrical and Computer Engineering\n9\n9 Credits – Technical Electives\nEnvironmental Engineering\n9\n9 Credits – Technical Electives\nMaterials Science and Engineering\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nMechanical Engineering\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nPhotonics and Optical Systems\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nAI for Product Innovation\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nClimate and Sustainability Engineering\n0\nNot Available\nComputational Mechanics and Scientific Computing\n0\nNot Available\nCybersecurity\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nDesign and Technology Innovation\n6\n6 Credits – Technical Electives\nFinTech\n0\nNot Available\nGame Design, Development and Innovation\n0\nNot Available\nMedical Technology Design\n0\nNot Available\nRisk Engineering\n0\nNot Available\nInternship, project, or equivalent requirement may be fulfilled as described below.\nIn the fourth year, each MEng student is required to undertake a practical internship, which must encompass at least 320 hours of effort (as documented in their detailed laboratory notebook). These internships are by nature focused on engineering applications and technology development. To achieve this, each MD/MEng student may work under the auspices of Faculty in the School of Medicine, MedBlue Program, the Pratt School of Engineering, or other similar program to be reviewed and approved by representatives from the MEng and SOM faculty. Specifically, each MD/MEng candidate will:\nwork under the guidance of one or two attending physicians and engineers during their 4th year (“second third year”) to identify and complete at least one comprehensive Confidential Need Specification with the sponsorship of one of the clinical faculty;\ndevelop new technologies or engineering approaches (including optimization/system analysis or feasibility analysis, etc.) for improving human health based on the Need Specification;\npresent their proposed technology or engineering approach to a select group of prospective investors and/or end users (clinicians);\ncomplete an Invention Disclosure Form approved by faculty advisor for the project and the faculty who teach the internship course, MEng 551\n(optional) submit the IDF, which requires review and signature of appropriate SOM Department Chair; review and signature by appropriate Engineering Department Chair.\n(optional) provide required information and support to OLV to assist in their review and action.\nExample Curriculum\nThe MD/MEng is most closely aligned with the Biomedical Engineering major and is ideal for medical students with an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. The example below shows the Pratt course work requirements for a major in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Healthcare Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\nThe MEng in Biomedical Engineering with Emphasis on Health Care Innovation and Entrepreneurship\nRequirement\nMD-MEng Fulfillment of Requirement\nCore Industry Preparation Courses (6 credits)\nMEng 540 Management of High Tech Industries (3 credits)\nMEng 570 Business Fundamentals for Engineers (3 credits)\nLife Science (3 credits)\nSatisfactory completion of SoM 1 Basis Sciences\nAdvanced mathematics (3 credits)\nSee\nBME website\nfor approve math courses\nBME courses (9 credits)\nBME 590.01 – Biomedical Device Innovation (3 credits)\nSelect from BME offerings described in\nBME curricular notes\n(6 credits)\nEngineering Elective (3 credits)\nBME 490 Special Topics in BME Design (3 credits)\nOther technical electives (6 credits)\nCompletion of SoM 1 Basic Sciences fulfills this requirement\nInternship, Project or Equivalent (zero credits)\nMENG 550 Internship or Applied Research Project\nMENG 551 Internship/Project Assessment\nNote: students perform internship as described in this proposal\nBME seminar (zero credits)\nEGRMGMT 501 Engineering Management Seminar\nApplication Requirements and Process\nThe applicant must be in good standing with the School of Medicine. Applications should be submitted using an application to the Master of Engineering program. MD/MEng students should indicate on their application that they will be pursuing MEng as a concurrent degree.\nStudents interested in this program should apply no later than March 15 in the second year of the MD program.\nSee the links below for more information.\nApplication deadlines\nApplication Requirements\n(Note that applicants may use MCAT scores in lieu of GRE scores for the MD-MEng dual degree only.)\nApply online\nReview Process\nThe student must inform the Third Year Study Program Director in the School of Medicine, the Director of Masters Studies in the appropriate MEng major, and the Pratt Professional Masters Admissions Office so that the application and dual degree plan can be reviewed and approved separately from the Pratt School general admissions review.\nTuition\nStudents will pay\nMaster of Engineering tuition\nfor one year (two semesters) after the MS2 year and School of Medicine tuition for four years (SoM 1, SoM 2, SoM 3 [year 4], and SoM 4[year 5]). The typical MEng degree is 3 semesters and so obtaining a concurrent degree saves students the equivalent of one semester of tuition compared to obtaining both degrees separately.\nGranting of Degree\nBecause this is a concurrent degree and School of Medicine courses are being used to fulfill MEng degree requirements, the MEng degree will be granted simultaneous to the granting of the MD degree, typically at the end of the 5th year. If a MD/MEng student leaves the MD program before completing both degrees, a case-by-case analysis may be performed to determine if the MEng degree may be granted independently or if additional coursework is required to independently fulfill the MEng degree requirements. Since no accommodation has been made to the MD requirements, students withdrawing from the MEng degree will not impact MD degree requirements.\nMaster of Public Policy + Master of Engineering\nThe MPP/MEng dual degree program is a three-year program.\nFor full-time students, the program can be completed in three continuous years of full-time study, leading to a Master of Engineering and Master of Public Policy degrees, both conferred by Duke.\nThe MEng/MPP program will be a 6-semester program requiring students to complete a minimum of 30 units of credit registered through the Pratt School of Engineering (MEng) and 39 units of credits for the Sanford School of Public Policy (MPP).\nFor some MEng tracks, up to 6 units taken in the MPP curriculum may be used to fulfill MEng degree requirements. See below for a list of the maximum units MPP that may be counted per MEng track. Appendix A may be updated by Directors of Graduate Studies without requiring approval of the enBre agreement by both schools.\nIf the student does not complete the dual degree curriculum and pursues only a single degree, the curriculum will then be changed to the full degree requirements for a non-dual degree student for the respective school.\nEach program will continue to manage admissions and financial aid independently. Core curriculum and degree requirements will also be established by the respective programs autonomously.\nImportant Notes\nSeparate applications and admission to each professional school are required\nStudents requiring additional coursework beyond six (6) semesters will incur additional charges\nStudents do not receive either degree until all requirements for both degrees are completed\nTrack\nName\nMaximum MPP credits that may count toward MEng degree.

Only classes where the student earned a “B” or better are eligible to be transferred to the degree program. Note that tuition for these courses is paid separately from any other programs a student is currently taking.\nNon-degree students may take any graduate course within Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering.\nApplication Requirements\nNon-degree applicants submit most standard application materials, including:\nAn application fee, to be paid via credit card\nA transcript of your bachelor’s degree in engineering or science from an accredited institution\nA resume\nShort answer essays\nTwo recommendations\nA short video introduction\nNon-degree students are not required to submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores.\nDetailed requirements\nApplication Deadline\nNon-degree applications should be submitted by March 15, or until the application closes.",
